# Naveasy

Naveasy was designed to help you to implement you .NET MAUI app in compliance with the MVVM principles.

For now, to use it make sure all your views and view models follows the naming convention:
- Your pages must be named: {whatever}Page
- Your view models must be named: {whatever}PageViewModel
- Both page and VM MUST be on the same namespace.

In the next release we're going to remove these naming convension requirements.

To better understand how to use it follows the Sample on this repo.
